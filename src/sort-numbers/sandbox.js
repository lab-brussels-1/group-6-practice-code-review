// sort has a compare function that takes two numbers and compares them. if a is greater than b,
// it returns a positive number and sorts the a after b for ascending order.
// if a negative number because b is greater than a, a is placed before.
// for equal, order isn't changed. for further details, consult MDN docs

// for first iteration, a: 3 and b: 1 - r: 2
// a: 4, b: 3 - r: 1
// a: 2, b: 4 - r: -2
// a:2, b: 3 - r: -1
// a:2, b: 1 - r: 1

// so it compares one number with the number next to it and if it's smaller,
// leaves it there otherwise swaps them and then compares the swapped one with the next
// swaps again if swapped one is larger. compares again with the next one until it has put
// the largest one to the end. Keeps one putting largest ones to the end
// by comparing it with the one next to it?
